        <h1><b>It starts with movement</b></h1><br></br>
        <p>We believe movement is at the core of what it means to feel healthy, to feel alive, to engage in the human experience. We believe every step, jump, or lap puts people on the path toward a more active, and fulfilling life. Whether that means an afternoon walk, an invigorating dance class, or a heart-pounding set of squats, movement is vitally important. In fact, its so important that we have made it our mission to Get People Moving.</p><br></br>
        <h2><b>Why ACE</b></h2><br></br>
        <p>As the leading nonprofit organization certifying health coaches and exercise professionals, the American Council on Exercise (ACE) seeks to get people moving worldwide. In addition to setting the highest industry standards and elevating the careers of health coaches and exercise professionals, our commitment to the ACE mission inspires us to collaborate with like-minded organizations, top research institutions, policymakers on the federal and state level, fitness industry leaders and diverse community organizations to increase physical activity for improved public health. By offering NCCA-accredited certification programs, continuing education, and access to easy to understand evidence-based health and fitness information, we invest in our mission to get people moving–so people from all backgrounds are equipped to lead active, healthy lives.</p><br></br>
